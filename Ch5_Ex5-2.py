# Fermat's Last Theorem says that there are no positive integers 'a', 'b' and 'c' such that
# a^n + b^n = c^n
# for any values of 'n' greater than 2.

# 1. Write a function names 'check_fermat' that takes four parameters (a, b, c and n) and checks to see if Fermat's
# Theorem holds. If 'n' is greater than two and 'a^n + b^n = c^n' the program should print "Holy smokes, Fermat was
# wrong!". Otherwise, the program should print "No, that doesn't work".


# 2. Write a function that prompts the user to input values for 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'n', converts them to integers and
# uses 'check_fermat' to check whether they violate Fermat's Theorem.
