# If you are given three sticks, you may or may not be able to arrange them in a triangle. For example, if one of the
# sticks is 12 inches longs and the other two are one inch long, you will not be able to get the short sticks to meet
# in the middle.

# 1. Write a function named 'is_triangle' that takes three integers as arguments and prints either "Yes" or "No",
# depending on whether you can or cannot form a triangle from sticks with the given length.


# 2. Write a function that prompts the user to input three stick lengths, converts them to integers and uses
# 'is_triangle' to check whether the sticks with the given lengths can form a triangle.
