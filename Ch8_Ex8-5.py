# A Caesar cypher is a weak form of encryption that involves "rotating" each letter by a fixed number of places.
# Write a function called 'rotate_word' that takes a string and an integer as parameters and returns a new string that
# contains the letters from the original string rotated by the given amount.
# You might want to use the built-in function 'ord', which converts a character to a numeric code, and 'chr' which
# converts numeric codes to characters. But beware: numeric code for uppercase letters are different.

def rotate_word(s, n):
    pass
