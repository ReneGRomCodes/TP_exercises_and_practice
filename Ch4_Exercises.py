# 1. Write a function called 'square' that takes a parameter named 't', which is a turtle. It should use the turtle to
# draw a square.
# Write a function that passes 'bob' as an argument to 'square' and then run the program again.


# 2. Add another parameter, named 'length' to square. Modify the body so length of the sides is 'length' and then modify
# the function call to provide a second argument. Run the program again. Test your program with a range of values for
# length.


# 3. Make a copy of square and change the name to 'polygon'. Add another parameter named 'n' and modify the body, so it
# draws an n_sided regular polygon.


# 4. Write a function called 'circle' that takes a turtle 't' and radius 'r' as parameters and draw an approximate
# circle by calling 'polygon' with an appropriate length and number of sides. Test your function with a range of values
# for 'r'.


# 5. Make a more general version of 'circle' called 'arc' that takes an additional parameter 'angle', which determines
# what fraction of a circle to draw. 'angle' is in units of degrees, so when 'angle=360', 'arc' should draw a complete
# circle.
