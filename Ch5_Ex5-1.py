# The 'time' module provides a function, also named 'time', that returns the current GMT in "the epoch", which is an
# arbitrary time used as a reference point. On UNIX systems, the epoch is January 1st, 1970.

import time
print(time.time())

# Write a script that reads the current time and converts it to a time of day in hours, minutes and seconds, plus the
# number of days since the epoch.
