# Exercise 13-1: Write a program that reads a file, breaks each line into words, strips whitespace and punctuation from
# the words and converts them to lowercase.


# Exercise 13-2: Go to Project Gutenberg (http://gutenberg.org) and download your favorite out-of-copyright book in
# plain text format.
# Modify your program from the previous exercise to read the book you downloaded, skip over the header information at
# the beginning of the file and process the rest of the words as before.
# Then modify the program to count the total number of words in the book and the number of times each word is used.
# Print the number of different words used in the book. Compare different books by different authors, written in
# different eras. Which author uses the most extensive vocabulary?


# Exercise 13-3: Modify the program from the previous exercise to print the 20 most frequently used words in the book.


# Exercise 13-4: Modify the previous program to read a word list (use 'Ch9_words.txt') and then print all the words in
# the book that are not in the word list. How many of them are typos? How many of them are common words that should be
# in the word list and how many of them are really obscure?
