# Exercise 11-1: Write a function that reads words in 'Ch9_words.txt' and stores them as keys in a dictionary. It
# doesn't matter what the values are. Then you use the in operator as a fast way to check whether a string is in the
# dictionary.


# Exercise 11-2: Read the documentation of the dictionary method 'setdefault' and use it to write a more concise version
# of 'invert_dict'.


# Exercise 11-3: Memoize the Ackermann function from exercise 6-2 and see if memoization makes it possible to evaluate
# the function with bigger arguments.


# Exercise 11-4: If you did exercise 10-7, you already have a function named 'has_duplicates' that takes a list as a
# parameter and returns 'True' if there is any object that appears more than once in the list. Use a dictionary to write
# a faster, simpler version of 'has_duplicates'.


# Exercise 11-5: Two words are "rotate pairs" if you can rotate one of them and get the other. Write a program that
# reads a wordlist and finds all the rotate pairs.
