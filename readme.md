# Think Python (2nd Edition) – My Solutions

This repo contains my personal solutions to the exercises in *Think Python, 2nd Edition* by Allen B. Downey.

It started out as a way to learn Python from scratch and evolved into a chaotic but glorious journey through functions,
loops, recursion hell, and the occasional existential crisis.

## 📘 Book Info
- Title: *Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist*  
- Author: Allen B. Downey  
- Edition: 2nd  
- Link: [Think Python 2e online version](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/)

## 💡 Why this repo exists

Back when I first started learning Python, I needed a place to:
- Practice coding exercises from the book.
- Rage against recursion.
- Over-engineer simple problems for fun.
- Draw triangles with turtles because why the hell not.

Now it’s here for reference, review, and maybe even inspiration if you're walking the same path.

## 🧠 What’s inside

- Code for most (if not all) exercises in the book.
- Some extended/expanded versions of basic exercises (couldn’t resist).

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These solutions were mostly written when I was still green — they may not always be optimal, but they work (unless they
don’t, in which case: oops).

Use them as a reference, comparison, or to feel better about your own code.
