# Exercise 10-1: Write a function called 'nested_sum' that takes a list of lists of integers and adds up the elements
# from all the nested lists.

# For example:
# t = [[1, 2], [3], [4, 5, 6]]
# nested_sum(t)
# 21





# Exercise 10-2: Write a function called 'cumsum' that takes a list of numver and returns the cumulative sum; that is,
# a new list where ith element is the sum of first i+1 elements from the original list.

# For example:
# t = [1, 2, 3]
# cumsum(t)
# [1, 3, 6]





# Exercise 10-3: Write a function called 'middle' that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all but the
# first and last elements.

# For example:
# t = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# middle(t)
# [2, 3]





# Exercise 10-4: Write a function called 'chop' that takes a list, modifies it by removing the first and last elements,
# and returns 'None'.

# For example:
# t = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# chop(t)
# print(t)
# [2, 3]





# Exercise 10-5: Write a function called 'is_sorted' that takes a list as a parameter and return 'True' if the list is
# sorted in ascending order and 'False' otherwise.

# For example:
# print(is_sorted([1, 2, 2]))
# True
# print(is_sorted(['b', 'a']))
# False





# Exercise 10-6: Write a function called 'is_anagram' that takes two strings and returns 'True' if they are anagrams.





# Exercise 10-7: Write a function called 'has_duplicates' that takes a list and returns 'True' if there is any element
# that appears more than once. It should not modify the original list.
