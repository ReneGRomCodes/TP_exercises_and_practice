# The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 'a' and 'b' is the largest number that divides both of them with no remainder.
# One way to find the GCD of two numbers is base on the observation that ir 'r' is the remainder when 'a' is divided by
# 'b', then 'gcd(a,b) = gcd(b,r)'. As a base case, we can use 'gcd(a,0) = a'.
# Write a function called 'gcd' that takes parameters 'a' and 'b' and returns their GCD.
