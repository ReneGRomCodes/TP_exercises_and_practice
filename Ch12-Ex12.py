# languages.

# Exercise 12-2: More anagrams!
# 1. Write a program that reads a word list from a file and prints all the sets of words that are anagrams.
# 2. Modify the previous program so that it prints the longest list of anagrams first, followed by the second longest,
#    and so on.
# 3. In Scrabble, a "bingo" is when you play all seven tiles in your rack, along with a letter on the board, to form an
#    eight-letter word. What collection of eight letters forms the most possible bingos'


# Exercise 12-3: Two words form a "metathesis pair" if you can transform one into the other by swapping two letters; for
# example, "converse" and "conserve". Write a program that finds all the metathesis pairs in the dictionary.

def find_metathesis_pair(file):
    pass
